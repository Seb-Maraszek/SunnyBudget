This GitHub repository contains the source code for a web application that helps users calculate the profitability of installing solar panels for their home or business. The app takes into account the user's location, electricity usage, and the cost of installation to provide an estimate of the savings and payback period for installing solar panels.

Users can input their current electricity usage, their location, and the size of the solar panel system they are considering installing. The app then calculates the estimated cost of the system, taking into account federal and state incentives and financing options. It also estimates the amount of energy the system will produce and the amount of money saved on electricity bills.

The app uses real-time energy data and solar irradiance information for the user's location to provide accurate estimates. Users can also adjust the assumptions used in the calculations to see how changes in electricity rates or solar panel costs would impact the system's profitability.

This Solar Panel Profitability Calculator is a useful tool for anyone considering installing solar panels, as it provides an easy-to-use and accurate estimate of the system's financial benefits. The code is open-source and available for anyone to use or modify.
